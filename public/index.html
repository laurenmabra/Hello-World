  <p>Photography has always interested me. I’ve always wanted to pursue it, but it just never made it to the top of my to do list. I do have experience taking pictures but, like most people, only with "point and shoot" cameras and my iPhone. Of course, I can still take beautiful pictures that way but I'm really interested in learning about the specifics such as exposure, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO just to name a few.</p>
<h3>For Professional Development</h3>
  <p>Photography would be fun just as a hobby but it would also really help me in my career. A major part of what I do is content creation. So many of the individuals and businesses that I’ve worked with wanted me to do social media/content marketing but have zero content! I have found this to be a major pinpoint of businesses (especially smaller, local companies). When I learn photography, I will be able to offer this as an additional service. Clients who don’t have a process set up for capturing unique pictures and videos will no longer have to resort to overused stock photography. I’ll be their all-in-one social media content expert.</p>
<h3>Just for Fun</h3>
  <p>In and outside of my job, I have a passion for creating. Picking up photography will just serve as another outlet and tool for me to create more no matter where I am. With that being said, understanding photography will play major role in capturing moments and memories while traveling. </p>

  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I was born in Missouri, moved around quite a bit to different states (and even a different country), and for the past 10+ years have been proud to call St. Pete my home. I recently graduated from the <a href="https://www.usfsp.edu/home/"> University of South Florida</a> with my bachelor's degree in marketing. In and outside of work, as mentioned above, I love being doing anything that requires creativity: writing, video editing, and brainstorming/proposing new ideas. I look forward to finding new ways to get involved with St. Pete's dynamic businesses, entrepreneurial individuals, and ever-growing community.</p>
